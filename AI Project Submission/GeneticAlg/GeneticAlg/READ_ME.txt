please use UTF_8 for the map files

if the SDL screen is too small for the map the screen can be made bigger at the bottom

to change the map please put the text file into the same folder as the others and change the name of the file variable in the code

if the map is too large for the chromosomes i have currently the length variable must be increased but kept as a multiple of 2
